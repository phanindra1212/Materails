Spring Boot
================
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

Features
============
Create stand-alone Spring applications
Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

A Comparison Between Spring and Spring Boot
===========================================================

4. Maven Dependencies
First of all, let's look at the minimum dependencies required to create a web application using Spring:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.0.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-webmvc</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.0.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
Unlike Spring, Spring Boot requires only one dependency to get a web application up and running:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.5.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
All other dependencies are added automatically to the final archive during build time.

Another good example is testing libraries. We usually use the set of Spring Test, JUnit, Hamcrest, and Mockito libraries. In a Spring project, we should add all these libraries as dependencies.

But in Spring Boot, we only need the starter dependency for testing to automatically include these libraries.

Spring Boot provides a number of starter dependencies for different Spring modules. Some of the most commonly used ones are:

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
spring-boot-starter-security
spring-boot-starter-test
spring-boot-starter-web
spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
For the full list of starters, also check out the Spring documentation.

5. MVC Configuration
Let's explore the configuration required to create a JSP web application using both Spring and Spring Boot.

Spring requires defining the dispatcher servlet, mappings, and other supporting configurations. We can do this using either the web.xml file or an Initializer class:
public class MyWebAppInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer {
  
    @Override
    public void onStartup(ServletContext container) {
        AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext context
          = new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();
        context.setConfigLocation("com.baeldung");
  
        container.addListener(new ContextLoaderListener(context));
  
        ServletRegistration.Dynamic dispatcher = container
          .addServlet("dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(context));
          
        dispatcher.setLoadOnStartup(1);
        dispatcher.addMapping("/");
    }
}
We also need to add the @EnableWebMvc annotation to a @Configuration class and define a view-resolver to resolve the views returned from the controllers:

@EnableWebMvc
@Configuration
public class ClientWebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer { 
   @Bean
   public ViewResolver viewResolver() {
      InternalResourceViewResolver bean
        = new InternalResourceViewResolver();
      bean.setViewClass(JstlView.class);
      bean.setPrefix("/WEB-INF/view/");
      bean.setSuffix(".jsp");
      return bean;
   }
}
By comparison to all this, Spring Boot only needs a couple of properties to make things work, once we've added the web starter:


spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/jsp/
spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
All the Spring configuration above is automatically included by adding the Boot web starter, through a process called auto-configuration.

What this means is that Spring Boot will look at the dependencies, properties, and beans that exist in the application and enable configuration based on these.

Of course, if we want to add our own custom configuration, then the Spring Boot auto-configuration will back away.


6. Spring Security Configuration
For the sake of simplicity, we'll see how the default HTTP Basic authentication is enabled using these frameworks.

Let's start by looking at the dependencies and configuration we need to enable Security using Spring.

Spring requires both the standard the spring-security-web and spring-security-config dependencies to set up Security in an application.

Next, we need to add a class that extends the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and makes use of the @EnableWebSecurity annotation:

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class CustomWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  
    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
          .withUser("user1")
            .password(passwordEncoder()
            .encode("user1Pass"))
          .authorities("ROLE_USER");
    }
  
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
          .anyRequest().authenticated()
          .and()
          .httpBasic();
    }
     
    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
Here we're using the inMemoryAuthentication to set up the authentication.

Similarly, Spring Boot also requires these dependencies to make it work. But we need to define only the dependency of spring-boot-starter-security as this will automatically add all the relevant dependencies to the classpath.

The security configuration in Spring Boot is the same as the one above.

If you need to know how the JPA configuration can be achieved in both Spring and Spring Boot, then check out our article A Guide to JPA with Spring.

7. Application Bootstrap
The basic difference in bootstrapping of an application in Spring and Spring Boot lies with the servlet. Spring uses either the web.xml or SpringServletContainerInitializer as its bootstrap entry point.

On the other hand, Spring Boot uses only Servlet 3 features to bootstrap an application. Let' talk about this in detail.

7.1. How Spring Bootstraps?
Spring supports both the legacy web.xml way of bootstrapping as well as the latest Servlet 3+ method.

Let's see the web.xml approach in steps:

Servlet container (the server) reads web.xml
The DispatcherServlet defined in the web.xml is instantiated by the container
DispatcherServlet creates WebApplicationContext by reading WEB-INF/{servletName}-servlet.xml
Finally, the DispatcherServlet registers the beans defined in the application context
Here's how Spring bootstraps using Servlet 3+ approach:

The container searches for classes implementing ServletContainerInitializer  and executes
The SpringServletContainerInitializer finds all classes implementing WebApplicationInitializer
The WebApplicationInitializer creates the context with XML or @Configuration classes
The WebApplicationInitializer creates the DispatcherServlet with the previously created context.
7.2. How Spring Boot Bootstraps?
The entry point of a Spring Boot application is the class which is annotated with @SpringBootApplication:

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
By default, Spring Boot uses an embedded container to run the application. In this case, Spring Boot uses the public static void main entry-point to launch an embedded web server.

Also, it takes care of the binding of the Servlet, Filter, and ServletContextInitializer beans from the application context to the embedded servlet container.

Another feature of Spring Boot is that it automatically scans all the classes in the same package or sub packages of Main-class for components.

Spring Boot provides the option of deploying it as a web archive in an external container as well. In this case, we have to extend the SpringBootServletInitializer:

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
    // ...
}
Here the external servlet container looks for the Main-class defined in the META-INF file of the web archive and the SpringBootServletInitializer will take care of binding the Servlet, Filter, and ServletContextInitializer.

8. Packaging and Deployment
Finally, let's see how an application can be packaged and deployed. Both of these frameworks support the common package managing technologies like Maven and Gradle. But when it comes to deployment, these frameworks differ a lot.

For instance, the Spring Boot Maven Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Maven. It also allows packaging executable jar or war archives and running an application “in-place”.

Some of the advantages of Spring Boot over Spring in the context of deployment include:

Provides embedded container support
Provision to run the jars independently using the command java -jar
Option to exclude dependencies to avoid potential jar conflicts when deploying in an external container
Option to specify active profiles when deploying
Random port generation for integration tests



Exceute Spring Boot 
===============================
i)Maven 
    mvn spring-boot:run

ii)Gradle
gradle bootRun

iii) java -jar target/mywebserviceapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Different ways of Creating Spring Boot Project
======================================================

Ø  Create Spring Boot Project with Spring Initializr.
Ø  Create Spring Boot Project with Spring Starter Eclipse Plugin.
Ø  Generate Spring Boot Project with a simple Maven Project in Eclipse.



package com.in28minutes.springboot.tutorial;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootWebApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootWebApplication.class, args);
    }
}
All you need to do is add @SpringBootApplication and use the SpringApplication.run() static method to launch the Spring application context.

When you launch this class as a Java application, you will see that an embedded Tomcat server launches and you are ready to add features to this application.

In spring boot application we can execute any task just before spring boot finishes its startup. 
Spring Boot provides two interfaces, CommandLineRunner and ApplicationRunner, to run specific pieces of code when an application is fully started. These interfaces get called just before run() once SpringApplication completes.

CommandLineRunner
================
This interface provides access to application arguments as string array. Let's see the example code for more clarity.

@Component
public class CommandLineAppStartupRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CommandLineAppStartupRunner.class);
    @Override
    public void run(String...args) throws Exception {
        logger.info("Application started with command-line arguments: {} . \n To kill this application, press Ctrl + C.", Arrays.toString(args));
    }
}

ApplicationRunner

ApplicationArguments interface, which has many convinent methods to get arguments, like 
getOptionNames() to return all the arguments' names, 
getOptionValues() to return the agrument value, and 
raw source arguments with method getSourceArgs(). Let's see an example:

@Component
public class AppStartupRunner implements ApplicationRunner {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AppStartupRunner.class);
    @Override
    public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {
        logger.info("Your application started with option names : {}", args.getOptionNames());
    }
}


When to Use It
FYI, Spring Batch relies on these runners in order to trigger the execution of the jobs.
When you want to execute some piece of code exactly before the application startup completes, you can use it then. 
In one of our projects, we used these to source data from other microservices via service discovery, which was registered in Consul.

Q) What is the difference between CommandLineArgument and ApplicationRunner?
ANS :-Working process of CommandLineRunner and ApplicationRunner are same, but CommandLineRunner (CLR) holds data in String[] format where as Application (AR) holds data as ApllicationArguments as Option/Non-Option format.

https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-boot/command-line-runner-interface-example/


application.Properties
=======================
1. It holds in key=value format
2. Keys are two types 
        A.Spring Boot defined (Predefined) 
		b)custom Keys 
		
		NOTE :-
a. Allowed special symbol are dot(.), dash (-) and underscore (_).
b. Key=value both are String type, Spring supports both are String type, Spring supports type conversation (ex: Stringint) automatically.
c. To read one key-value in code use Legacy 
syntax: @Value(“${key}”)

@ConfigurationProperties("my.prod")



YAML (YAMlian Language) 
It is representation style of key=val without duplicate levels in keys if they are lengthy and having common levels.
File extension is “.yml”.
It will hold data in below format 
    	  key : <space> value

Key=value format List<DataType>/Set<DataType>/Array(<DataType>[]) Style :-
In properties file we can use from zero.
In yml file use just dash (-) with <space> value under same level.

Ex:- application.proeprties
my.code.version[0]=V1
my.code.version[1]=V2
my.code.version[2]=V3

---application.yml :--
my:
   code:
        version:
            -V1
            -V2
            -V3

final meaning is:                	 
               

Key=value format Map/Properties Style :-
Consider below example
	

Its equal properties file will be 
Ex:- application.properties
my.data.model.a1=6.6
my.data.model.a2=8.6
my.data.model.a3=9.6
Its equal : application.yml file
my: 
   data:
        model:
              a1: 6.6
              a2: 8.6
              a3: 9.6



Place Holder process in yml (or) properties File
Internal placeholders are used to re-use existed key value for another key as a part or full.
Read as ${fullPathKey} (it must be properties style even in yml file)

application.properties 
my.dt.pid=68
my.dt.mid=${my.dt.pid}

application.yml :-
my:
       dt:
           pid: 68
           mid: ${my.dt.pid}

NOTE :-
1.Symbol ‘#’ indicates a comment line in yml file.
2.Using 3 dash (---) symbols in yml is divided into multiple files internally (mainly used for profiles**)

Spring Boot Profiles
=================================================\

Profile Code	Properties File	              Class level Annotation
Default	  application.properties	       @Profile(“default”)
Prod	application-prod.properties		@Profile(“prod”)
Uat	application-uat.properties		@Profile(“uat”)
Qa	application-qa.properties		@Profile(“qa”)
Cloud	application-cloud.properties		@Profile(“cloud”)



NOTE :-
1.Use key spring.profiles.active=profile
We can provide using 3 ways. Those are
a. Command Line Arguments (Option Arguments)
Ex :-      --spring.profiles.active=prod
b.In application.proeprties
     Ex :-    spring.profiles.active=prod
c.VM (JVM/System) Argument :-
Ex :-     -Dspring.profiles.active=prod
Right click on Starter class  Run AsRun Config Choose Arguments
Enter below format in VM Arguments
     -Dspring.profiles.active=prod
apply and Run

2.Key Search highest priority is given in same profile properties file, if key is not found in current  profile properties file then goes to default properties file.
If no where key is found then 
a.@Value generate Exception (IllegalArgumnetException)
b.@ConfigurationProperties :- Default value of DataType is chosen by container.
application.properties	application-prod.properties	application-uat.properties
A=10	A=15	A=30
B=7	B=20	
C=6		

Case#1 spring.profiles.active=prod then
Key	Value
A	15
B	20
C	6
D	0 ( for int type default value)

Case#2 spring.profiles.active=uat

Key	Value
A	30
B	7
C	6
D	0 (for int type default value)

Including Child Profiles :-
In spring Boot applications active profile can be specified using key
     Ex:    --spring.profiles.active=[----]
In this case one properties file is loaded into memory which may have more set of key=value pairs.
These can be divided into multiple child properties file and loaded through active profile, also called as “Profiles Include”.
This can be done using key spring.profiles.include=-,-,-,-
Example :-


Spring Container will load :-
Parent (main) Profiles first (all its key=value pairs)
Then child profiles in given order will be loaded.
For above example, priority for loading (loading order is)
     a. application-prod.properties
     b. application-pemail.properties
     c. application-db.properties
